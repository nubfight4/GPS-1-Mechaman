Welcome to the training simulation system, rookies, here I will be teaching you all the things you need to know about this Mecha. (Press enter to proceed)
If you haven’t notice, there’s some bars on top of the screen. 
You're health bar is colored blue. The red one is your enemy's’ health bar. There's also a purple bar, but we'll go into that later.
First off we need a dummy! Let me just materialize one out now!
... ... ...
I guess we ran out of budget to create a dummy. 
Well, let's just use this dummy on the right for now, one of our old member made it invincible for training. (Press <P> to skip the tutorial)
Now, for the pilot controlling the movement, go ahead and dance like a wild beast, show your dominance! (Press <A> or <D> to Move around, <W> to jump, <S> to crouch)
You make me proud, movement pilot! Now get some rest. Attacking pilot, its your time to shine!
Let's try some punching and blocking, simple yet effective to bring down out terrif.... unique dummy! (Press Left Mouse Button to Punch, Right Mouse Button to block)
Haha, seems simple right? Now here's something that would give you a bit of a challenge. Some combo attacks!
Here's a basic combo attack, <3 Way Punch>! (Press Left Mouse Button 3 times)
Well done! Attacking pilot, would you mind switching weapons? (Press <Y> for yes, <N> for no)
Great! Now, let us proceed. (Press <Right Shift> to switch weapon)
As you can see, you now have have a blaster! Go on, take a shot! (Press Left Mouse Button to shoot)
Now we can talk about the purple bar. That bar is a Bullet bar, our Blaster can't shoot all the time, so let it charge after shooting.
Great work! Now that both of you know how to pilot the mecha, its time for some teamwork moves!
These moves require both of you to execute, so get ready to be in Sync with each other.
Let's do a <Low Kick>, both pilots need to work together to make this attack! (Press <S>, <D>, Left Mouse Button in quick succesion)
Haha, both of you are so in sync, might as well have the same mind, or better yet, be married as husband and wife! Haha!
Don't take it too seriously, it's just a joke! Well done with the tutorial, its time for you to venture out to you're Epic Journey!!

Oh.... You're the first to say you mind....
Are you sure? You can swap into a pretty cool thing! (Press <Y> for yes, <N> for no)
C'mon, I know you wan't to swap!
Last chance! Are you really sure you don't wanna swap? (Press <Y> for yes, <N> for no)
Fine, I guess you will learn sooner or later.

Are you sure you want to skip the tutorial? (Press <Y> to skip the tutorial, Press <N> to cancel the skip)
Oh my, both of you pilots already know how to pilot the mech, I see I'm not needed to teach the controls.
Well, I guess it's time for you to venture out to you're Epic Journey!!
