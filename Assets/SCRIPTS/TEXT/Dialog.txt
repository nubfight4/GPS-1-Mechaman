Welcome to the training simulation system, rookies. (Press B (on controller) or Enter to proceed)
I will be teaching you amazing stuff about this Mecha. 
The blue bar up there is your health bar and the red one is your enemy's health bar.
Now, it's time for you two to learn some combat skills. 
Now movement pilot, go ahead and dance like a wild beast to show dominance.
*Use Left Thumb Stick or Direction Pad to move around* 
You make me proud, movement pilot! Now get some rest. Attacking pilot, it's your time to shine!
Try your best to fight against this extremely scary and vicious enemy. 
* Press X or A to attack the enemy*
*Press the X button three times to perform a combo attack*
Alright before you two leave, now both pilots try to work together and do some synchronized attacks.
* Movement pilot try to move up while the attacking pilot does a normal attack at the same time! *
You guys can check the other moves that Mechaman has in the Controls page from the Pause menu.
Now off you go!
