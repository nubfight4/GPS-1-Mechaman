Welcome to the training simulation system, rookies. I will be teaching you amazing stuff about this Mecha. (Press enter to proceed)
The blue bar up there is your health bar and the red one is your enemies health bar.
Now, it's time for you two to learn some combat skills. 
... ... ...
Wait there's no enemy?
Well, we ran out of budget. Just take this.
Now movement player, go ahead and dance like a wild beast to show dominance.
*Use Left Thumb Stick or Direction Pad to move around* 
You make me proud, movement pilot! Now get some rest. Attacking player, its your time to shine!
Try your best to fight against this extremely scary and vicous enemy. 
* Press X or A to attack the enemy, Press B to block*
Well... At least you tried blocking against an enemy that doesn't attack.
It shows you're good at following instructions at least.
Come on, I'll teach you a new thing or two.
*Press the X button three times to perform Shadowless Strike!*
Well, time to bring your partner involved, remember that you two are one now, you have to go into each other's...... mind.
*Both players press X at the same time to perform a Jump Punch!*
Fantastic, before letting you two go, use that magic button Start to magically make everyone stop moving and pause the game.
You can also look for moveset controls there.
Now you two are ready for your epic adventure. Now go and battle some epic monsters and make me proud!
